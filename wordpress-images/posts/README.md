# WordPress Post Images

This folder contains full-size images used within the content of GEDIS project blog posts and educational pages published in WordPress.

Each image is typically inserted **inside the body of a post**, accompanying text or as part of multilingual dissemination strategies. These images are **not** used as featured thumbnails, which are managed separately in the `thumbnails/` folder.

## Naming conventions

- Use **descriptive filenames** based on the topic and language code.
- Example:  
  - `delphi-method-explained-en.png`  
  - `mujeres-ingenieria-es.jpg`  
  - `gender-data-visualisation-de.webp`

## Recommendations

- Maximum file size: **150â€¯KB** (optimised for web).
- Accepted formats: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.svg` (only if vector-based).
- Avoid long filenames and non-ASCII characters.
- Include alt text and source attribution in WordPress when embedding.

## Organisation

- Files can be grouped by language, date, or thematic block.
- Consider creating subfolders if the number of files becomes large (e.g., `2025/`, `interviews/`, etc.).

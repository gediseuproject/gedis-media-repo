# WordPress Thumbnails

This folder contains thumbnail images used as featured images for GEDIS blog posts in WordPress.

Each image represents a post and is designed for previews, listings, and sharing on social media platforms. Multilingual versions can be organised using language codes in the filenames (e.g., `open-data-thumb-en.jpg`, `gender-policy-thumb-es.webp`).

## Recommendations

- Target file size: 70–90 KB
- Recommended dimensions: 1200 × 630 px (Open Graph standard)
- Formats: `.jpg`, `.webp`, optimised `.png`
- Use short, descriptive filenames with consistent suffixes

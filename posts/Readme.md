# WordPress Post Images

This folder contains full-size images used in GEDIS-related blog posts published via WordPress.

Each image corresponds to one post, and multiple language versions may exist when needed. Filenames should clearly indicate the post topic and language code (e.g., `open-data-guide-en.png`, `gender-equality-policy-es.jpg`).

These images are typically inserted into the content of posts and not used as featured images.

## Recommendations

- Optimise file size (max 150â€¯KB).
- Use consistent naming conventions.
- Supported formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, `.svg` (for vector graphics).
